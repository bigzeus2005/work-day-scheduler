### Description  
In this project, we were tasked with:  

- Creating a daily planner with the current day displayed at the top of the calender
- Creating time blocks for standard business hours
- Ensuring each time block was color coded to indicate if it was in the present, past, or future
- Being able to enter an event in any time block selected and saving it to local storage
- Upon page refresh, those events remained on the page 


After completing these initial tasks. I worked on hitting all the points outlined in the grading criteria. I created a new repository on GitHub titled work-day-scheduler and deployed my changes to the site using the git add, git commit, and git push commands.  

I deployed the site to a live URL and submitted that link along with my GitHub URL. I also ensured there were no load errors and made sure my GitHub repository contained the application code. As well as, ensured the application resemebled the mock-up provided in the homework instructions.  

Lastly, I gave the repository a unique name, ensuring it followed best practices for file structure and naming conventions, as well as, following best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, and quality comments. I made sure the repository contained multiple descriptive commit messages and a quality README file with a description, screenshot, and a link to the deployed application.
